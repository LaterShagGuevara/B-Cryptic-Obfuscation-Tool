## 🧠 What Is B-Cryptic?

**B-Cryptic** is a next-generation obfuscation system designed to render plaintext undetectable and uninterpretable—by humans, machines, and AI alike.

Built on the novel **Practical Obfuscation Pad (POP)** concept, it leverages **3072 token definitions**, randomized substitution, prefix masking, and zero-repeat encoding to transform text into data that appears meaningless—yet is perfectly reversible by design (if and only if the full system context is known).

It’s **not encryption**.  
It’s stealth.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- ✅ **100% reversible encoding/decoding** with full token accuracy
- ✅ 95 ASCII characters + space supported (printable QWERTY)
- ✅ **32 unique tokens per character** across 8 encoding tables
- ✅ **Word-level obfuscation** for 750+ common English terms
- ✅ **Dynamic prefix rotation:** `+`, `*`, `^`, `[-` (confuses pattern matching)
- ✅ Zero collisions: **no repeated token** appears in any message
- ✅ Built-in **PDF batch encoding/decoding engine**
- ✅ Sleek **Tkinter GUI** with:
  - Text and PDF tabs
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Console-style logs and error handling

## 🖥️ GUI Preview

The `b_cryptic_ui.py` interface offers:

- ✨ Encode/decode tab for plaintext
- 📄 PDF encoding & decoding tab (batch-compatible)
- 🌘 Dark mode with toggle button
- 🧾 Status/output window
- 💡 One-click file selection and action execution

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Secure but deniable communication
- Offensive security & red team payloads
- Metadata masking and stealth channels
- ARG/alternate reality games and cryptic puzzles
- Covert personal notes or time capsules
- Anti-AI/NLP communication protection
- Espionage roleplay, LARPing, or Cold War hobbyist projects

## 🔐 How It Works

1. Each character (`a–z`, `A–Z`, `0–9`, punctuation, space) has **32 distinct 25-character tokens**.
2. One or more of 8 randomized **token tables** are used per message.
3. **Prefixes** like `+`, `^`, `*`, and `[-` are rotated to obfuscate structure.
4. Tokens are sampled with zero repetition and stitched together—creating data that’s:
   - **Statistically meaningless**
   - **Impossible to brute-force**
   - **Only decodable with exact system definitions**

> Even with the full encoded string, you *cannot* reverse the message without access to all active tables and system logic.

## 🧪 Example: Obfuscated Message

> **Plaintext:**  
> `The deal is off. Burn everything.`

> **B-Cryptic Output (1 of infinite variations):**  
> `[+xtl2woT56a7054OBQJ65w840][+K6A3q7O66C48E94A4c03kVcP][+DX9fH5d21M891ik5958zLlo4]...[+xj24qi1lV5FC165o6aVc5118]`

> - No token appears twice  
> - No decoder can reverse this without full system knowledge  
> - AI/NLP sees this as statistical noise

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Each character** (a–z, A–Z, 0–9, punctuation, space) has 32 unique tokens.
2. **Table mix level** determines how many of the 8 tables are used.
3. **Prefixes** (`+`, `*`, `^`, `[`) are rotated randomly to confuse pattern detection.
4. **Message is reconstructed** using selected tokens, producing noise that resembles data gibberish, not communication.

To decode:
- You must have the correct 8 tables,
- Use the same mixing logic and prefix map,
- And match each token **exactly**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Launch GUI

python b_cryptic_ui.py


### Philosophy

B-Cryptic is not encryption.
It's stealth-by-design — a tool for those who want to communicate in plain sight with a zero-detection footprint.

Whether you’re a security researcher, privacy advocate, red teamer, puzzle builder, or just paranoid:

    B-Cryptic gives you the power to hide everything, including the fact you were hiding at all.
